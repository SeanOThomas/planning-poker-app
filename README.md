To install the Poker Planning App, navigate to the `app/build/outputs/apk/debug` directory.

There you will find the app file `app-debug.apk`.

It is recommended to move this file to an online directory (eg, Google Drive) for easy access on a mobile device. Once moved, simply click the file from your mobile device, and the app will automatically install.
